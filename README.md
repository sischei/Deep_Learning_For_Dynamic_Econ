# Deep Learning for Solving Dynamic Stochastic Models (May 22 â€“ 24, 2024)

This is an mini-course on "Deep Learning for Solving Dynamic Stochastic Models", held from Wednesday, May 22nd, 2024 2 - Friday, May 24th, 2024 at [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics, University of Leipzig](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/).


## Purpose of the lectures

* This mini-course is designed for Ph.D. students in economics and related disciplines. It introduces recent advancements in applied mathematics, machine learning, computational science, and the computational economics literature. The course focuses on solving and estimating dynamic stochastic economic models and performing parametric uncertainty quantification.

* The lectures will concentrate on two machine learning methodologies: Deep Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes. These methods will be explored through applications in macroeconomics and climate-change economics.

* The format of the lectures will be interactive and workshop-like, combining theoretical discussions with hands-on coding exercises. The coding will be conducted in Python and implemented on a cloud computing infrastructure.

### Teaching philosophy
Lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style,
using [Python](http://www.python.org), [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and
[Tensorflow probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) on [Nuvolos](http://nuvolos.cloud),
a browser-based cloud infrastructure in which files, datasets, code, and applications work together,
in order to directly implement and experiment with the introduced methods and algorithms.
