# Deep Learning for Solving and Estimating Dynamic Stochastic Models (May 22 – 24, 2024)

This is an mini-course on "Deep Learning for Solving and Estimating Dynamic Stochastic Models", held from Wednesday, May 22nd, 2024 2 - Friday, May 24th, 2024 at [Central-German Doctoral Program Economics, University of Leipzig](http://cgde.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/).


## Purpose of the lectures

* This is a mini-course intended to confront Ph.D. students in economics and related fields with recent tools developed in applied mathematics, machine learning, computational science, and the computational economics literature to solve and estimate (dynamic stochastic) economic models, and perform parametric uncertainty quantification.

* The lectures will be centered around two types of machine learning methods, that is, Deep Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes. They will be showcased
in the context of application in macroeconomics and climate-change economics.

* The lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style, that is, a mix of theory and actively playing with code examples (delivered in Python and deployed on a cloud computing infrastructure).


## Class enrollment on the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/)

### Teaching philosophy
Lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style,
using [Python](http://www.python.org), [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and
[TFP](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) on [Nuvolos](http://nuvolos.cloud),
a browser-based cloud infrastructure in which files, datasets, code, and applications work together,
in order to directly implement and experiment with the introduced methods and algorithms.
