### Teaching philosophy
Lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style,
using [Python](http://www.python.org), [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), and
[TFP](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability) on [Nuvolos](http://nuvolos.cloud),
a browser-based cloud infrastructure in which files, datasets, code, and applications work together,
in order to directly implement and experiment with the introduced methods and algorithms.

### Lecturer
