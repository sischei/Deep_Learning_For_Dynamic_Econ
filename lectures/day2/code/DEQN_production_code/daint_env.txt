### First create a venv with these commands
module load cray-python/3.6.5.7
module load daint-gpu
module load TensorFlow/2.2.0-CrayGNU-19.10-cuda-10.1.168
python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
# in your slurm file you need to first reload python, gpu and tensorflow
# then load the vitual environment
# finally, the last lines tells him to use the venv package when there is a conflict. Without it you get very old version of some packages pre-installed with their version of tf. This was problematic for my code.
module load cray-python/3.6.5.7
module load daint-gpu
module load TensorFlow/2.2.0-CrayGNU-19.10-cuda-10.1.168
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/<path_to_venv>/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
